        "LangChain provides high-level APIs that enable users to build powerful applications in a few lines of code. However, it can be challenging to understand what is going on under the hood and to pinpoint the cause of issues. Phoenix makes your LLM applications _observable_ by visualizing the underlying structure of each call to your query engine and surfacing problematic \"spans\" of execution based on latency, token count, or other evaluation metrics.\n",

        "- Build a simple question and answer app using LangChain that uses retrieval-augmented generation to answer questions over the Arize documentation,\n",
        "- Record trace data in OpenInference format,\n",
        "- Inspect the traces and spans of your application to identify sources of latency and cost,\n",
        "- Export your trace data as a pandas dataframe and run an LLM-assisted evaluation to measure the precision@k of your retrieval step.\n",
